        ========
        
        WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing
        reads, also called *read-based phasing* or *haplotype assembly*. It is
        especially suitable for long reads, but works also well with short reads.
        
        Please :ref:`cite us if you use WhatsHap <howtocite>`.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
          * Very accurate results (Martin et al.,
            `WhatsHap: fast and accurate read-based phasing <https://doi.org/10.1101/085050>`_)
          * Works well with Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and other types of reads
          * It phases SNVs, indels and even “complex” variants (such as ``TCG`` → ``AGAA``)
          * Pedigree phasing mode uses reads from related individuals (such as trios)
            to improve results and to reduce coverage requirements
            (Garg et al., `Read-Based Phasing of Related Individuals <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw276>`_).
          * WhatsHap is :ref:`easy to install <installation>`
          * It is :ref:`easy to use <user-guide>`: Pass in a VCF and one or more BAM files, get out a phased VCF.
            Supports multi-sample VCFs.
          * It produces standard-compliant VCF output by default
          * If desired, get output that is compatible with ReadBackedPhasing
          * Open Source (MIT license)
