        WhatsHap
        ========
        
        WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing
        reads, also called *haplotype assembly*. It is especially suitable for long
        reads, but works also well with short reads.

        The version of WhatsHap you find here is the result of further development
        focused on making the software easy and straightforward to use. WhatsHap is now
        Open Source software under the MIT license and we welcome contributions.
        
        
        Pedigree phasing
        ----------------
        
        WhatsHap is capable of using pedigree information
        about individuals to further improve phasing results, and to drastically reduce
        the needed coverage. A preprint is available on bioRxiv:
        
            Read-Based Phasing of Related Individuals.
